# Tempo and Card Advantage in Pokemon Pocket



## Some History

The concept of [Tempo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo_(chess)) originated in Chess, but like most card game theory I first learned of it from Magic the Gathering. You can see it, along with Card Advantage, develop in classic articles like [Philosophy of Fire](https://web.archive.org/web/20070521041041/http://www.starcitygames.com/php/news/article/7157.html) and [Who's the Beat down?](https://web.archive.org/web/20241201213103/https://articles.starcitygames.com/articles/whos-the-beatdown/) by Mike Flores. I learned of them from a series of articles that WotC published on their website in the late 00's. Specifically [Introduction to Card Advantage](https://web.archive.org/web/20070311031938/http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/academy/11) by Ted Knutson and [Introduction to Tempo](https://web.archive.org/web/20090602020730/http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/academy/12) by Scott Johns. That entire series of articles was eye opening for me when I wanted to improve at the game, and if you're interested in Magic, I think they're still worth reading. You'll have to find them on the Way back Machine, though, since WotC doesn't seem to have them up anymore.

Over the years, understanding tempo and card advantage became crucial to improving at Magic, providing a way to evaluate cards, Deck building, and plays. If you play enough card games, you realize that these concepts apply not just to Magic, but to all card games and, if you abstract "card" to a generic "resource", to nearly all competitive games to a lesser or greater degree.

I'm going to focus just on Pokemon Pocket, which is not quite the same as the TCG, but if you're interested in tempo in the TCG, [Don't have a tempo tantrum](https://web.archive.org/web/20241225173154/https://sixprizes.com/2013/03/29/dont-have-a-tempo/) by Eric Nance is pretty great.

## Card Advantage

Card Advantage is, at least at first, the simpler of the two concepts. Simply put, if you have access to more cards than your opponent, you're more likely to win. It's also straightforward to measure since you only need to count how many cards you gained and subtract the cards you used to gain them. The cleanest example is Professor Oak--you spend a single card to draw two cards, a direct +1 in Card Advantage.

Removing or destroying your opponents cards also generates advantage. There's not a lot of discard or destruction in Pokemon, so the way you're most likely to gain this kind of advantage is by KOing Stage 1 and 2 Pokemon. When your Mewtwo ex knocks out your opponents Stage 2 Pokemon you've used a single card--Mewtwo--to remove 3 of your opponents: the basic, stage 1, and stage 2 Pokemon, netting you +2 Cards in advantage once your Mewtwo gets knocked out.

You can also create Virtual Card Advantage by invalidating your opponents cards by playing certain cards of your own. I don't believe there's anything like this in Pokemon Pocket now, but an example from Magic would be playing a deck with no creatures to invalidate all of your  opponent's creature removal spells. Since they have no targets for their spells drawing one is effectively the same as not drawing a card at all and you gain advantage each time they do.

Finally, you can create card advantage through card quality. This is pretty straightforward as well, if your cards are just better than your opponents, your more likely to win. If your opponent's deck was 20 Magikarps, it doesn't really matter if they start the game with all 20 in hand since any Pokemon that can deal damage means you'll win.

It's important to note that Card Advantage is zero sum--meanining every time your opponent gains card advantage, you lose it and vice versa. This is what makes drawing cards so powerful, it can become insurmountable. However, in Pokemon Pocket the importance of card advantage is diminished. While it's certainly not negligible, after all if you get to play  both your Oaks and your opponent does not you're probably in a better spot than they are, it is not as easy to achieve or as big of a difference as it is in other games.

There's not a lot of sources of card advantage in Pocket right now. Besides Oak, the only other source I can think of is Meowth, who is very risky to play and not very impactful outside of drawing a card. Chatot can provide more cards depending on how your opponent plays, but is mostly for improving the quality of your hand by giving you a chance to draw better cards. Over time we may get better card drawing, but we'll still run into the another barrier: 20 cards is not a lot. You will eventually run out of cards and your opponent will naturally eat away at that since they will continue to draw cards while you cannot.
