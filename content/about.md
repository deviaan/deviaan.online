# About

Hey there! I'm deviaan and this is my hobby site. Primarily, its a place to share anything interesting I might stumble onto, and share projects or stories--if I ever finish any of them. I hope you get as much of a kick out of being here as I did making it!

## Gear

I've always been intrigued by the tools and techs people use, so I thought I'd share mine for anyone who shares that curiosity!

### Hardware

![My Current computer](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1_6iVhkyRSbgUBeMVUZNViyTl7hl6EpDA "My computer")

```
Processor: Ryzen 5 7600
Graphics Processor: Zotac Nvidia 3060 Ti
Motherboard: ASRock B650M PG Riptide
Memory: Kingston Fury Beast DDR5 5200Mt/s CL 40 16 GB (x2)
Storage: Kingston NV2 1TB M.2 SSD
Power Supply: AData XPG Pylon 750W 80+ Bronze
Additional: Thermalright Assassin King 120 SE CPU Fan
```

I build my computer in 2023 and have been pretty happy with it so far. It's not "top end" or anything, but it's been able to play any game I want without issue. I was worried at first because the Ryzen 7xxx line tends to get pretty hot, but after researching it seems like my fan should be able to handle it. I don't see temps above 70&#176;C.

### Software

*Operating System*: Windows 11 Home. I've used every major operating system and tend to prefer Linux. However, I needed to use Windows when I went back to school a few years ago, so I've been using that at home lately.

*Editors*: I use a few different editors, depending on my platform, mood, and what I'm working on.
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/): The first code editor I ever used! It was a long time ago now, but I still like using Notepad++ for anything that's not too complicated.
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/): I started using Vim when I first got serious about programming. I don't know that it makes me any faster, but whenever I'm in a command line it is my preferred method of editing. [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is also a really cool project that can completely replace larger IDEs if you want it to.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): It ook me a while to find a niche that VS Code could fill. I don't like it for very large projects because I hate managing so many extensions--especially if I'm switching languages and load up a bunch of useless ones. I also didn't like it for smaller scripts because it felt like overkill. However, with this hobby site, I finally have a project that's just between simple scripts and what I do at work. After the initial HTML, which I wrote in Notepad++, I swapped to VS Code and have been very happy with it!
- [JetBrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/): This is what I use at work--mostly Pycharm but sometimes WebStorm as well. I used Rider for some classes at school. I think once you need more than 2 of the IDEs, the all product pack is worth getting. They are my go-to tools for anything demanding, and I don't see that changing anytime soon.
