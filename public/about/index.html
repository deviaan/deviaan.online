<p>Hey there! I&rsquo;m deviaan and this is my hobby site. Primarily, its a place to share anything interesting I might stumble onto, and share projects or stories&ndash;if I ever finish any of them. I hope you get as much of a kick out of being here as I did making it!</p>
<h2 id="gear">Gear</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been intrigued by the tools and techs people use, so I thought I&rsquo;d share mine for anyone who shares that curiosity!</p>

</code></pre><p>I build my computer in 2023 and have been pretty happy with it so far. It&rsquo;s not &ldquo;top end&rdquo; or anything, but it&rsquo;s been able to play any game I want without issue. I was worried at first because the Ryzen 7xxx line tends to get pretty hot, but after researching it seems like my fan should be able to handle it. I don&rsquo;t see temps above 70Â°C.</p>
<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<p><em>Operating System</em>: Windows 11 Home. I&rsquo;ve used every major operating system and tend to prefer Linux. However, I needed to use Windows when I went back to school a few years ago, so I&rsquo;ve been using that at home lately.</p>
<p><em>Editors</em>: I use a few different editors, depending on my platform, mood, and what I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>: The first code editor I ever used! It was a long time ago now, but I still like using Notepad++ for anything that&rsquo;s not too complicated.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>: I started using Vim when I first got serious about programming. I don&rsquo;t know that it makes me any faster, but whenever I&rsquo;m in a command line it is my preferred method of editing. <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a> is also a really cool project that can completely replace larger IDEs if you want it to.</li>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>: It ook me a while to find a niche that VS Code could fill. I don&rsquo;t like it for very large projects because I hate managing so many extensions&ndash;especially if I&rsquo;m switching languages and load up a bunch of useless ones. I also didn&rsquo;t like it for smaller scripts because it felt like overkill. However, with this hobby site, I finally have a project that&rsquo;s just between simple scripts and what I do at work. After the initial HTML, which I wrote in Notepad++, I swapped to VS Code and have been very happy with it!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains IDEs</a>: This is what I use at work&ndash;mostly Pycharm but sometimes WebStorm as well. I used Rider for some classes at school. I think once you need more than 2 of the IDEs, the all product pack is worth getting. They are my go-to tools for anything demanding, and I don&rsquo;t see that changing anytime soon.</li>
</ul>
